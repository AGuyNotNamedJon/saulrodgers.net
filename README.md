# Personal Site / Blog

This is my personal site and blog, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed from GitHub to Azure.

## üåç About
Hi, I'm Saul Rodgers! My journey into IT began with a deep curiosity for troubleshooting and a passion for problem-solving. I was fascinated by how different systems interact, which led me to explore endpoint management and cloud technologies.

This site is my space to share experiences, insights, and projects as I navigate the ever-evolving world of IT.

I primarily work with Microsoft Intune, Exchange Online, and Entra ID. Lately, I've been expanding my knowledge in Defender and Purview while also embarking on my journey into Azure.. This blog serves as my first hands-on experience with Azure, where I‚Äôve chosen an intentionally complex setup to challenge myself and deepen my understanding.

Alongside this site, I maintain a [PowerShell scripts repository](https://github.com/AGuyNotNamedJon/PowerShellScripts), where I share useful automation scripts. To complement my PowerShell scripting, I'm also learning Python‚Äîstarting with GUI development for my scripts and exploring its potential for my workflow and IT management tasks.

This site serves as both a blog and a portfolio. Here, I document my learning journey, share technical insights, and provide useful tips for others in the IT community.

## üîç Always Exploring
I'm constantly experimenting with new tools, refining my approach, and looking for better ways to solve problems. Whether it's automating workflows, improving security, or diving deeper into cloud management, there's always something to tinker with. If you're on a similar path, let's keep exploring‚Äîthere‚Äôs always more to learn.
